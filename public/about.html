  <article>
    <p>My name is Zaid Neurothrone. I have had a life-long intellectual interest in the workings of the human mind and
      its manifest complexities. I see myself as an experimentalist, and that’s why I have been preoccupied with
      exploring a wide array of intellectual and academic interests, such as studying at university a social science
      like social anthropology, as well as studying natural sciences like biology and chemistry. These studies have all
      been attempts to try to discover how to express and work with my interests in the human mind. However, none of
      these have been as stimulating and as fruitful for my way of approaching the world as programming has proven to be
      ever since I was introduced to it under 2019. I am in particular interested by the experiential possibilities of
      Augmented Reality, and how this natural user interface can paradigmatically alter and augment the way we approach
      every facet of our technologically oriented societies and cultures.</p>

    <p>As an AR-developer I will strive to be on the cutting edge and bandwagon of this paradigmatic technological and
      medial shift. I hope to develop virtual tools and solutions to help everyone be as productive and creative as they
      can be whilst striving to realize their goals, be it at home or in the workplace. I’m especially interested in
      technical solutions that can help people with learning disabilities or cognitive disorders and illnesses – whether
      it be dyslexia, ADHD or dementia – live a more fulfilled and productive life.</p>

    <p>I believe AR will provide new tools to approach work and life, as well as making possible completely new ways of
      crossing boundaries, coming together and sharing formative social experiences.</p>
